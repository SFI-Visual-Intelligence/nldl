# NLDL Conference Style Template

This repository contains the LaTeX style template for the NLDL Conference. The template follows the official guidelines provided by the conference and is intended to ensure consistency and quality across all submissions.

## Usage

To use the NLDL Conference style template, simply download the `authorkit.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/SFI-Visual-Intelligence/nldl/releases/), and extract the `nldl.cls` into your working directory or in your local `texmf`.

Use it in your document as a class:
```
\documentclass[fullpaper]{nldl}
```

Additionally, you can use the `main.tex` as a guideline for your paper, and delete all the information within the `document` environment.
